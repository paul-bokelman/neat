# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) implementation

This is a Python implementation of the NEAT algorithm for evolving neural networks. It is based on the original NEAT paper by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. The implementation is designed to be easy to use and requires only a few lines of code to create and evolve a neural network.
